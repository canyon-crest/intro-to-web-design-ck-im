<h3>Background</h3>
<p id="p2"><img src="images/cca.jpeg" id="pic1"> Chloe Kim is a Korean American sophomore at <a href="https://cc.sduhsd.net/" target="_blank"> Canyon Crest Academy</a>, where she is a student with her older brother, Eliah Kim, who is a junior at the same school. Although she was born in San Diego, she lived in Washington state and northern California for a few years before moving back to San Diego in seventh grade. She cares about her core values: optimism, family, and trust. <span class="highlight">She tries to approach every situation with a positive mindset and surrounds herself with reliable and supportive people. </span> Her growing passion for science has allowed her to meet new people and participate in activities such as the Science Olympiad, where she could explore different fields of science.</p>

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p><img src="images/robotics.png" id="pic2"> Outside of school, Chloe enjoys staying active through tennis and golf. She plays for her school’s Junior Varsity tennis team and loves developing strategies and collaborating with her friends during doubles matches. When she is not active, she spends time solving puzzles and building projects, including building a mini wooden greenhouse or playing Minesweeper. She is also an active member of the <a href="https://team3128.org/" target="_blank"> 3128: Aluminum Narwhals robotics team</a> as a member of the Mechanical department. With her team, <span class="highlight">she works hands-on, building a robot </span> that competes in regional, state, and national competitions.</p>

<h3>Interests and Future</h3>
<p><img src="images/korea.jpg"> In the future, Chloe wishes to expand her creativity through different forms of expression. She wants to learn how to crochet to make thoughtful gifts for her close family and friends. She also wants to read a new book series or reread nostalgic books from her childhood. Chloe also wishes to continue <span class="highlight">trying new foods from different cultures,</span> which explains her food-related nickname, “Crabby Chloe.” She sees herself traveling, especially abroad in countries such as Japan or <a href="https://www.korea.net/" target="_blank">Korea</a>, and learning about the events that make each place unique.</p>
